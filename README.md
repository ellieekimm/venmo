<h1>venmo</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I replicated Venmo's UI in this SwiftUI project, created foro the App Team Final Gala.</p>
<p>This application was built using the MVVM model and heavily relies on sharing data between views, which greatly strengthened my skills in StateObjects and State/Binding variables.</p>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>Although this app focuses mostly on UI, the app allows you either request/pay friends whether on the Home page or Pay/Request page. These payments then show up in the history transactions or the home page, where users can comment or like different payments. Furthermore, the search bar on Pay/Request page is fully functional and allows users to search for specific users to pay for.</p>
